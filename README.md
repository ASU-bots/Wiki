#Welcome

Welcome to the ASU-Bots wiki.

Please visit the [Installation and Setup](https://github.com/ASU-bots/Wiki/wiki/Installation-and-Setup) page to make sure you're able to code using whatever tool you want. Tools are listed in alphabetical order.

If you are looking for something to do or wish to get caught up, please visit the [learning and tasks](https://github.com/ASU-bots/Wiki/wiki/Learning-and-Tasks) part of the wiki. (Warning: Some libraries like OpenCV and PCL may be hard to install on windows. If you do want to continue using windows while working with advanced libraries, I will only be able to help with unix-like compilers such as [mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/).)
