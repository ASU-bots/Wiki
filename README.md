#Welcome

Welcome to the ASU-Bots wiki.

If you are new to things and don't have a programming language set up, please download and install [python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/).

If you are looking for something to do or wish to get caught up, please visit the [learning and tasks](https://github.com/ASU-bots/Wiki/wiki/Learning-and-Tasks) part of the wiki. (Warning: Some libraries like OpenCV and PCL may be hard to install on windows. If you do want to continue using windows while working with advanced libraries, I will only be able to help with unix-like compilers such as [mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/).)

If you want to get things working as quickly as possible, please visit any of the respective wiki pages. ([Opencv](https://github.com/ASU-bots/Wiki/wiki/OpenCV), [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/ASU-bots/Wiki/wiki/Raspberry-Pi), [Arduino](https://github.com/ASU-bots/Wiki/wiki/Arduino) .)

There is also a <200$ underwater robot in the works, but it isn't complete.
